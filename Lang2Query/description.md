### **Initial Ideas**

#### **Step 1: Lexical Analysis**
- **Goal**: Tokenize the input sentence.  
  Example:  
  Input: *I want to search for the item with id equal to xxxxx.*  
  Actions:
  - **Scan words** and filter unnecessary components:  
    - **Redundant phrases**: *I want to ...*  
    - **Verbs**: *search for, extract, select*  
    - **Auxiliary verbs**: *is, am, are, was, were*  
    - **Nouns**: *item, field names, numbers*  
    - **Relational words**: *equal to, greater than, less than, is not equal to, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to*  
    - **Special words**: *none, null*  
  - Represent each operation as a key-value pair in a dictionary for further processing.

#### **Step 2: Syntax Analysis (Parsing)**
- **Purpose**: Check whether the sentence has valid syntax.  
- **Process**:
  - Generate an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** to focus on the meaningful content of the code while ignoring unnecessary details.
  - Utilize **in-order traversal** for parsing and validation.

#### **Step 3: Semantic Analysis**
- **Tasks**:
  - **Variable Validation**: Check if variables are of the correct type according to the schema.  
  - **Control Flow**: Ensure that *search for* has an associated variable and a final value.  
  - **Consistency**: Validate that the called function matches the defined function.  
  - **Symbol Table Operations**: Support insertion, deletion, update, and search operations.  
  - **Error Handling**: If any of the above checks fail, identify and report the specific issue.

#### **Step 4: Code Generation**
- Transform the validated syntax and semantics into executable code, either SQL or NoSQL queries, depending on the backend requirements.

#### **Step 5: Backend Integration**
- Deploy the generated code to the backend for execution. Handle database interactions and return results in a standardized format.

### **Overall Architecture**

1. **Core Complexity of the Task**  
   User inputs in "quasi-natural language" exhibit diversity and ambiguity, making direct lexical and syntactic analysis challenging. This requires:
   - **Clear Definition of a Fixed Language Structure**: Design a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) or Regular Grammar to ensure that input sentences are sufficiently clear and easy to parse.
   - **Support for Language Extensions**: The grammar rules must be designed to accommodate future extensions for more sentence patterns and functionalities.

2. **SQL and NoSQL Compatibility Issues**  
   - SQL typically requires structured tables (relations), while NoSQL databases may use document, key-value, or graph-based models.
   - User input needs to be semantically evaluated to determine whether it is more suitable for SQL or NoSQL execution and then adapted accordingly.

3. **Modular Implementation of the Project**  
   To ensure scalability and maintainability, the project is implemented in a modular manner:
   - **Frontend Module**: Handles user input, including interface design and basic input validation.
   - **Compiler Module**: Performs lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis, and generates code.
   - **Backend Module**: Interacts with databases, executes SQL or NoSQL queries, processes results, and returns outputs.
   - **Error Handling Module**: Detects errors and provides clear feedback.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### **Step 1: Lexical Analysis**
- **Tool Recommendations**:
  - Use existing lexical analysis libraries (e.g., Python's `lex` or `nltk`) combined with regular expressions to quickly define lexical rules.
  - Construct tokens for different types (e.g., keywords, variable names, operators) to create lexical units.

- **Enhancements**:
  - Define a dictionary mapping natural language to database keywords, e.g.:
    ```
    "search for" -> "SELECT"
    "equal to" -> "="
    "greater than" -> ">"
    ```
  - Handle ambiguous expressions like "find items where id matches xxxxx" and "get all records with id xxxxx," which should be parsed into similar token sequences.

#### **Step 2: Syntax Analysis**
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Generation**:
  - Use tools like `PLY` (Python Lex-Yacc) or `antlr` to generate syntax trees based on well-defined CFG.
  - Example rules:
    ```
    QUERY -> VERB OBJECT CONDITION
    VERB -> "search for" | "find" | "get"
    OBJECT -> "item" | "record" | "document"
    CONDITION -> "with" FIELD RELATION VALUE
    FIELD -> "id" | "name" | "price" | ...
    RELATION -> "equal to" | "greater than" | ...
    VALUE -> NUMBER | STRING
    ```

- **Syntax Error Handling**:
  - If input does not match CFG rules, return specific error messages, such as missing verbs or condition expressions.

#### **Step 3: Semantic Analysis**
- **Symbol Table Design**:
  - Maintain a symbol table recording variable types, scopes, and values, e.g., `{"id": "int", "name": "string"}`.
  - Verify field existence and ensure type consistency with database definitions.

- **Consistency Checks**:
  - Ensure that relational operators match field types. For example, "id greater than 'abc'" is invalid since `id` should be numeric.

- **Dynamic Semantic Support**:
  - For ambiguous conditions like "find all items with id not null," dynamically adjust the syntax tree structure to provide support.

#### **Step 4: Code Generation**
- **SQL Generation Rules**:
  - Define templates to transform the syntax tree into SQL statements, e.g.:
    ```
    AST: QUERY -> VERB OBJECT CONDITION
    Output: "SELECT * FROM items WHERE id = xxxxx;"
    ```

- **NoSQL Generation Rules**:
  - Generate queries based on database type (e.g., MongoDB), e.g.:
    ```
    AST: QUERY -> VERB OBJECT CONDITION
    Output: db.items.find({ "id": xxxxx })
    ```

- **Challenges**:
  - Support complex queries with conditions, sorting, and pagination, e.g.:
    ```
    User Input: "Find all items with id greater than 10 and price less than 100."
    SQL: SELECT * FROM items WHERE id > 10 AND price < 100;
    NoSQL (MongoDB): db.items.find({ $and: [ { id: { $gt: 10 } }, { price: { $lt: 100 } } ] });
    ```

#### **Step 5 & Step 6: Execution and Return**
- **Backend Connection**:
  - Use ORM frameworks (e.g., SQLAlchemy or MongoEngine) for database connections and operations.
  - Standardize return results in JSON format for easier frontend parsing and display.

- **Error Handling**:
  - If generated SQL or NoSQL queries fail, provide user-friendly error messages with potential reasons.

### **Future Optimization and Expansion Directions**

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT or BERT) to improve semantic understanding of user inputs, especially for ambiguous or complex sentences.

2. **User-Customized Features**:
   - Allow users to extend query templates, e.g., defining "look for" as equivalent to "search for."

3. **Multi-Database Support**:
   - Dynamically adapt to various database types and allow users to specify the target database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB).

4. **Code Generator Optimization**:
   - Introduce an Intermediate Representation (IR) for easier adaptation to more back-end databases or functionalities.

5. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests to validate the correctness of lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and code generation modules.
